INTERACTIVE PORTFOLIO — README
==============================

Welcome, traveler! You’ve stumbled upon **Nil’s Interactive Portfolio**, a  CV disguised as a
RPG Character selection.

FEATURES
========

**Navigation** — Jump between Experience, Missions, Contact...  
**Sound effects** — Because silence is for PowerPoint presentations.
**JavaScript-powered transitions** — Each section is its own "screen" with smooth switching.  
**“More info here!” links** — Take you straight to the *Missions* section for related projects. 
**Zero frameworks** — Built with 100% pure HTML, CSS, and JS — no Reacts were harmed in the making.
